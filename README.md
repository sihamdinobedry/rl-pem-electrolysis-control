# rl-pem-electrolysis-control
MSc Dissertation Project: This work explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (Proximal Policy Optimization) for adaptive control of a PEM electrolyser. Developed in Python, it demonstrates a 19.4% efficiency gain over traditional PID methods, contributing to sustainable hydrogen production for ammonia synthesis.
